# KG-MTDNN: Knowledge-Guided Multi-Task Deep Neural Network

This repository contains the source code and input dataset used in the paper:

**"Assessing and Projecting Soil and Ecosystem Respiration on the Earth's Third Pole Using Knowledge-Guided Multi-Task Deep Learning"**

## Contents

All files are located in the `Code_&_Input` folder:

- `KG-MTDNN.py`: Python script for training and applying the KG-MTDNN model
- `Input.xlsx`: Input dataset used for model training and validation

The `Input.xlsx` file contains six sheets:

- `rsgs`: Soil respiration (Rs) during the growing season  
- `rsngs`: Soil respiration (Rs) during the non-growing season  
- `rsa`: Annual soil respiration (Rs)  
- `regs`: Ecosystem respiration (Re) during the growing season  
- `rengs`: Ecosystem respiration (Re) during the non-growing season  
- `rea`: Annual ecosystem respiration (Re)
